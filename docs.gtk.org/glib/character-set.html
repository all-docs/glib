<p>The <a href="func.convert.html"><code>g_convert()</code></a> family of function wraps the functionality of
iconv(). In addition to pure character set conversions, GLib has functions
to deal with the extra complications of encodings for file&nbsp;names.</p>
<h2 id="file-name-encodings">File Name Encodings<a class="md-anchor" href="#file-name-encodings" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Historically, <span class="caps">UNIX</span> has not had a defined encoding for file names: a file
name is valid as long as it does not have path separators in it (“/”).
However, displaying file names may require conversion: from the character
set in which they were created, to the character set in which the
application operates. Consider the Spanish file name “Presentación.sxi”. If
the application which created it uses <span class="caps">ISO</span>-8859-1 for its&nbsp;encoding,</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  ó  n  .  s  x  i
Hex code:   50 72 65 73 65 6e 74 61 63 69 f3 6e 2e 73 78 69
</code></pre></div>

<p>However, if the application use <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8, the actual file name on disk would
look like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Character:  P  r  e  s  e  n  t  a  c  i  ó     n  .  s  x  i
Hex code:   50 72 65 73 65 6e 74 61 63 69 c3 b3 6e 2e 73 78 69
</code></pre></div>

<p>Glib uses <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 for its strings, and <span class="caps">GUI</span> toolkits like <span class="caps">GTK</span> that use GLib do
the same thing. If you get a file name from the file system, for example,
from <code>readdir()</code> or from <a href="method.Dir.read_name.html"><code>g_dir_read_name()</code></a>, and you wish to
display the file name to the user, you will need to convert it into <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8.
The opposite case is when the user types the name of a file they wish to
save: the toolkit will give you that string in <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 encoding, and you will
need to convert it to the character set used for file names before you can
create the file with <code>open()</code> or <code>fopen()</code>.</p>
<p>By default, GLib assumes that file names on disk are in <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 encoding. This
is a valid assumption for file systems which were created relatively
recently: most applications use <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 encoding for their strings, and that
is also what they use for the file names they create. However, older file
systems may still contain file names created in “older” encodings, such as
<span class="caps">ISO</span>-8859-1. In this case, for compatibility reasons, you may want to
instruct GLib to use that particular encoding for file names rather than
<span class="caps">UTF</span>-8. You can do this by specifying the encoding for file names in the
<code>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</code> environment variable. For example, if your installation
uses <span class="caps">ISO</span>-8859-1 for file names, you can put this in your <code>~/.profile</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>export G_FILENAME_ENCODING=ISO-8859-1
</code></pre></div>

<p>GLib provides the functions <a href="func.filename_to_utf8.html"><code>g_filename_to_utf8()</code></a> and
<a href="func.filename_from_utf8.html"><code>g_filename_from_utf8()</code></a> to perform the necessary conversions. These
functions convert file names from the encoding specified in
<code>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</code> to <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 and vice-versa.  This diagram illustrates how
these functions are used to convert between <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 and the encoding for file
names in the file&nbsp;system.</p>

<h2 id="checklist-for-application-writers">Checklist for Application Writers<a class="md-anchor" href="#checklist-for-application-writers" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>This section is a practical summary of the detailed things to do to make
sure your applications process file name encodings&nbsp;correctly.</p>
<ol>
<li>If you get a file name from the file system from a function such as
   <code>readdir()</code> or <code>gtk_file_chooser_get_filename()</code>, you do not need to do
   any conversion to pass that file name to functions like <code>open()</code>,
   <code>rename()</code>, or <code>fopen()</code> — those are “raw” file names which the file
   system&nbsp;understands.</li>
<li>If you need to display a file name, convert it to <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 first by using
   <a href="func.filename_to_utf8.html"><code>g_filename_to_utf8()</code></a>. If conversion fails, display a string
   like “Unknown file name”. Do not convert this string back into the
   encoding used for file names if you wish to pass it to the file system;
   use the original file name&nbsp;instead.</li>
<li>For example, the document window of a word processor could display
   “Unknown file name” in its title bar but still let the user save the
   file, as it would keep the raw file name internally. This can happen if
   the user has not set the <code>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</code> environment variable even
   though he has files whose names are not encoded in <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8.</li>
<li>If your user interface lets the user type a file name for saving or
   renaming, convert it to the encoding used for file names in the file
   system by using <a href="func.filename_from_utf8.html"><code>g_filename_from_utf8()</code></a>. Pass the converted file
   name to functions like <code>fopen()</code>. If conversion fails, ask the user to
   enter a different file name. This can happen if the user types Japanese
   characters when <code>G_FILENAME_ENCODING</code> is set to <span class="caps">ISO</span>-8859-1, for&nbsp;example.</li>
