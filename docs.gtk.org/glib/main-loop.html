<p>The main event loop manages all the available sources of events for GLib and
<span class="caps">GTK</span> applications. These events can come from any number of different types
of sources such as file descriptors (plain files, pipes or sockets) and
timeouts. New types of event sources can also be added using
<code>g_source_attach()</code>.</p>
<p>To allow multiple independent sets of sources to be handled in different
threads, each source is associated with a <code>GMainContext</code>.  A <code>GMainContext</code>
can only be running in a single thread, but sources can be added to it and
removed from it from other threads. All functions which operate on a
<code>GMainContext</code> or a built-in <code>GSource</code> are&nbsp;thread-safe.</p>
<p>Each event source is assigned a priority. The default priority,
<code>G_PRIORITY_DEFAULT</code>, is 0. Values less than 0 denote higher priorities.
Values greater than 0 denote lower priorities. Events from high priority
sources are always processed before events from lower priority&nbsp;sources.</p>
<p>Idle functions can also be added, and assigned a priority. These will be run
whenever no events with a higher priority are ready to be&nbsp;processed.</p>
<p>The <code>GMainLoop</code> data type represents a main event loop. A GMainLoop is
created with <code>g_main_loop_new()</code>. After adding the initial event sources,
<code>g_main_loop_run()</code> is called. This continuously checks for new events from
each of the event sources and dispatches them. Finally, the processing of an
event from one of the sources leads to a call to <code>g_main_loop_quit()</code> to
exit the main loop, and <code>g_main_loop_run()</code> returns.</p>
<p>It is possible to create new instances of <code>GMainLoop</code> recursively.  This is
often used in <span class="caps">GTK</span> applications when showing modal dialog boxes. Note that
event sources are associated with a particular <code>GMainContext</code>, and will be
checked and dispatched for all main loops associated with that&nbsp;GMainContext.</p>
<p>Libraries may contain wrappers of some of these functions, e.g.
<code>gtk_main()</code>, <code>gtk_main_quit()</code> and <code>gtk_events_pending()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-source-types">Creating new source types<a class="md-anchor" href="#creating-new-source-types" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>One of the unusual features of the <code>GMainLoop</code> functionality is that new
types of event source can be created and used in addition to the builtin
type of event source. A new event source type is used for handling <span class="caps">GDK</span>
events. A new source type is created by “deriving” from the <code>GSource</code>
structure. The derived type of source is represented by a structure that has
the <code>GSource</code> structure as a first element, and other elements specific to
the new source type. To create an instance of the new source type, call
<code>g_source_new()</code> passing in the size of the derived structure and a table of
functions. These <code>GSourceFuncs</code> determine the behavior of the new source&nbsp;type.</p>
<p>New source types basically interact with the main context in two ways. Their
prepare function in <code>GSourceFuncs</code> can set a timeout to determine the
maximum amount of time that the main loop will sleep before checking the
source again. In addition, or as well, the source can add file descriptors
to the set that the main context checks using <code>g_source_add_poll()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="customizing-the-main-loop-iteration">Customizing the main loop iteration<a class="md-anchor" href="#customizing-the-main-loop-iteration" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Single iterations of a <code>GMainContext</code> can be run with
<code>g_main_context_iteration()</code>. In some cases, more detailed control of
exactly how the details of the main loop work is desired, for instance, when
integrating the <code>GMainLoop</code> with an external main loop.  In such cases, you
can call the component functions of <code>g_main_context_iteration()</code> directly.
These functions are <code>g_main_context_prepare()</code>, <code>g_main_context_query()</code>,
<code>g_main_context_check()</code> and <code>g_main_context_dispatch()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="state-of-a-main-context">State of a Main Context<a class="md-anchor" href="#state-of-a-main-context" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>The operation of these functions can best be seen in terms of a state
diagram, as shown in this&nbsp;image.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="mainloop-states.gif"></p>
<p>On <span class="caps">UNIX</span>, the GLib mainloop is incompatible with <code>fork()</code>. Any program using
the mainloop must either <code>exec()</code> or <code>exit()</code> from the child without
returning to the&nbsp;mainloop.</p>
<h2 id="memory-management-of-sources">Memory management of sources<a class="md-anchor" href="#memory-management-of-sources" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There are two options for memory management of the user data passed to a
<code>GSource</code> to be passed to its callback on invocation. This data is provided
in calls to <code>g_timeout_add()</code>, <code>g_timeout_add_full()</code>, <code>g_idle_add()</code>, etc.
and more generally, using <code>g_source_set_callback()</code>. This data is typically
an object which ‘owns’ the timeout or idle callback, such as a widget or a
network protocol implementation. In many cases, it is an error for the
callback to be invoked after this owning object has been destroyed, as that
results in use of freed&nbsp;memory.</p>
<p>The first, and preferred, option is to store the source <span class="caps">ID</span> returned by
functions such as <code>g_timeout_add()</code> or <code>g_source_attach()</code>, and explicitly
remove that source from the main context using <code>g_source_remove()</code> when the
owning object is finalized. This ensures that the callback can only be
invoked while the object is still&nbsp;alive.</p>
<p>The second option is to hold a strong reference to the object in the
callback, and to release it in the callback’s <code>GDestroyNotify</code>. This ensures
that the object is kept alive until after the source is finalized, which is
guaranteed to be after it is invoked for the final time. The
<code>GDestroyNotify</code> is another callback passed to the ‘full’ variants of
<code>GSource</code> functions (for example, <code>g_timeout_add_full()</code>). It is called when
the source is finalized, and is designed for releasing references like&nbsp;this.</p>
<p>One important caveat of this second approach is that it will keep the object
alive indefinitely if the main loop is stopped before the <code>GSource</code> is
invoked, which may be&nbsp;undesirable.</p>
<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial<a class="md-anchor" href="#tutorial" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p><code>GMainContext</code> is complicated, and can be particularly intimidating for
developers new to working with GLib. Unfortunately, improper use of
<code>GMainContext</code> often results in bugs that may be difficult to debug. The
<a href="https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/main-contexts.html">Main Contexts tutorial</a>
provides valuable guidance for developers working with <code>GMainContext</code>
and is highly recommended reading. In particular, the section
<a href="https://developer.gnome.org/documentation/tutorials/main-contexts.html#using-gmaincontext-in-a-library">Using GMainContext in a Library</a>
documents several pitfalls that library authors should&nbsp;avoid.</p>
