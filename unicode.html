<p>GLib has support for various aspects of Unicode, and provides a number of APIs for dealing
with Unicode characters and&nbsp;strings.</p>
<p>There are analogues of the traditional <code>ctype.h</code> character classification and case conversion
functions, <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 analogues of some string utility functions, functions to perform normalization,
case conversion and collation on <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8 strings and finally functions to convert between the <span class="caps">UTF</span>-8,
<span class="caps">UTF</span>-16 and <span class="caps">UCS</span>-4 encodings of&nbsp;Unicode.</p>
<p>The implementations of the Unicode functions in GLib are based on the Unicode Character Data tables,
which are available from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/">www.unicode.org</a>.</p>
