        <div class="docblock">
          <p>The <code>GStaticRWLock</code> struct represents a read-write lock. A read-write
lock can be used for protecting data that some portions of code only
read from, while others also write. In such situations it is
desirable that several readers can read at once, whereas of course
only one writer may write at a&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following&nbsp;example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>  GStaticRWLock rwlock = G_STATIC_RW_LOCK_INIT;
  GPtrArray *array;

  gpointer
  my_array_get (guint index)
  {
    gpointer retval = NULL;

    if (!array)
      return NULL;

    g_static_rw_lock_reader_lock (&amp;rwlock);
    if (index &lt; array-&gt;len)
      retval = g_ptr_array_index (array, index);
    g_static_rw_lock_reader_unlock (&amp;rwlock);

    return retval;
  }

  void
  my_array_set (guint index, gpointer data)
  {
    g_static_rw_lock_writer_lock (&amp;rwlock);

    if (!array)
      array = g_ptr_array_new ();

    if (index &gt;= array-&gt;len)
      g_ptr_array_set_size (array, index + 1);
    g_ptr_array_index (array, index) = data;

    g_static_rw_lock_writer_unlock (&amp;rwlock);
  }
</code></pre></div>

<p>This example shows an array which can be accessed by many readers
(the <code>my_array_get()</code> function) simultaneously, whereas the writers
(the <code>my_array_set()</code> function) will only be allowed once at a time
and only if no readers currently access the array. This is because
of the potentially dangerous resizing of the array. Using these
functions is fully multi-thread safe&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>Most of the time, writers should have precedence over readers. That
means, for this implementation, that as soon as a writer wants to
lock the data, no other reader is allowed to lock the data, whereas,
of course, the readers that already have locked the data are allowed
to finish their operation. As soon as the last reader unlocks the
data, the writer will lock&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Even though <code>GStaticRWLock</code> is not opaque, it should only be used
with the following&nbsp;functions.</p>
<p>All of the g_static_rw_lock_<em> functions can be used even if
<code>g_thread_init()</code> has not been called. Then they do nothing, apart
from g_static_rw_lock_</em>_trylock, which does nothing but returning <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
<p>A read-write lock has a higher overhead than a mutex. For example, both
<code>g_static_rw_lock_reader_lock()</code> and <code>g_static_rw_lock_reader_unlock()</code> have
to lock and unlock a <code>GStaticMutex</code>, so it takes at least twice the time
to lock and unlock a <code>GStaticRWLock</code> that it does to lock and unlock a
<code>GStaticMutex</code>. So only data structures that are accessed by multiple
readers, and which keep the lock for a considerable time justify a
<code>GStaticRWLock</code>. The above example most probably would fare better with a
<code>GStaticMutex</code>.</p>
